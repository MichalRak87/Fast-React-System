"""
FastReactSystem

This module contains a class, FastReactSystem, which implements a system to process and
send reports based on screenshots taken from a website.
The processing includes checking if there are any reports
on the website, reading the report text using optical character recognition (OCR),
and storing the report text in a file. The file is then sent to an FTP server.

The class uses the following external packages:
- re
- ftplib
- os
- time
- pyautogui
- pytesseract
- credentials(optional)

It has the following methods:
- get_screenshot
Takes a screenshot of the website and returns the image.
- check_and_click_if_buttons
Check if buttons with the specified image are present on the website and clicks on them if they are.
- check_report
Check for reports on the website and sets the name of the report file if found.
- write_report_in_to_file
Reads the text from the screenshot of the report using OCR and writes the text to a file.
- send_to_ftp
Sends the report file to an FTP server.
- play
The main process of the system. It calls the above methods to process and send the report.

If the script is run as the main program, an instance of the FastReactSystem is created,
 a website is opened and brought to the foreground, and the play method is called three times.
